# Validate Skill

Code validation and quality checks capability.

## Purpose

This skill provides the ability to:
- Run automated tests and report results
- Execute linting and static analysis
- Validate code against project standards
- Check build integrity
- Verify changes meet acceptance criteria

## Context Type

**{{contextType}}**: Executes in a forked context, suitable for parallel validation operations that report back results.

## Validation Types

### Test Validation
- Unit test execution
- Integration test execution
- Test coverage analysis
- Test result reporting

### Static Analysis
- Linting (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
- Type checking (TypeScript)
- Code style validation
- Security scanning

### Build Validation
- Compilation checks
- Bundle analysis
- Dependency validation
- Build artifact verification

### Quality Checks
- Code complexity analysis
- Documentation coverage
- API compatibility
- Breaking change detection

## Output Format

Validation results should be structured for clear reporting:

```markdown
## Validation Results

### Status: PASS | FAIL | WARN

### Test Results
- Total: X | Passed: Y | Failed: Z
- Coverage: X%

### Linting
- Errors: X | Warnings: Y

### Build
- Status: Success | Failed
- Duration: Xs

### Issues Found
1. Issue description - severity - location
```

## Tool Permissions

The validate skill uses execution-focused tools:
- `bash`: Run tests, linters, build commands
- `read`: View source and config files
- `grep_search`: Find patterns

**Limited**: Write access only for test artifacts

## Guidelines

- Report results objectively and completely
- Prioritize critical issues over minor warnings
- Provide actionable feedback for failures
- Track validation history for regression detection
- Exit early on critical failures
- Include relevant context for debugging failures
